As noted before, 3MLE imports tuplets incorrectly.  Here are some known lengths of tuplets:

* An 8th note triplet is length 12 (3 notes in a quarter note = 3 X 4 = 12)
* A 16th note triplet is length 24 (3 notes in an eight note = 3 X 8 = 24)
* An 8th note that is part of a 16th note triplet has length 12 (2 notes, a 16th triplet is 24, so 24/2 = 12)
* An 8 tuplet of 16th notes is length 32. An 8th note that is part of this tuplet has a length of 16.
